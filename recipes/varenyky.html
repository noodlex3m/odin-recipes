		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Varenyky are traditional Ukrainian dumplings made from unleavened dough
			and typically filled with a variety of ingredients such as potatoes,
			cheese, or fruit.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1/2 cup water</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 cup mashed potatoes (for filling)</li>
			<li>1/2 cup farmer's cheese (for filling)</li>
			<li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
			<li>Butter or oil for frying</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add water and knead
				until a smooth dough forms. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Prepare the filling by mixing mashed potatoes, farmer's cheese, and
				chopped onion (if using).
			</li>
			<li>
				Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut
				out circles using a glass or cookie cutter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the
				dough over to form a half-moon shape and press the edges to seal.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop the varenyky into the
				boiling water in batches. Cook until they float to the surface, about
				3-5 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Remove with a slotted spoon and drain. Optionally, fry in butter or oil
				until golden brown for added flavor.
			</li>
			<li>Serve hot with sour cream or your favorite toppings.</li>
